`gulp serve`

Open a browser at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

## Code style and quality
Before contributing to the codebase, please familiarise yourself with [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html). This is the style guide we've decided to adhere to.

[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) is the CSS and HTML naming conversion that all new code should adopt.

Install a sass linter e.g. [Sass Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glen-84.sass-lint). The .sasslintrc file in this project has been configured to reflect the Google style guide. 

## Feature flags
The `./feature-flag-list.json` contains a list of future features. Any feature added to the **production** array will be seen in [demo](http://myservice-demo.herokuapp.com/) and any feature added **development** will be seen in [disco](http://myservice-disco.herokuapp.com/). To create new features, an ejs if statement is needed e.g. ` <% if (locals.liveFeature.includes('featureLsa')) { %> ` in the ejs file. 


## Visual regression testing

*Visual regression testing is under review.*
~~[BackstopJS](https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/) is avaliable in this repo. There are 2 gulp wrappers for running tests:  
`gulp unit-test` - runs a test on **just** the styleguide  
`gulp unit-test-all` - runs a test on **all** 400+ pages (this will take a long time)~~   
  
~~The first time you run a test, BackstopJS will generate reference screenshots (so it's best to do this on the master branch). Once that's done you'll need to run `gulp unit-test` again.~~
  
~~**Note** BackstopJS requirers [myservice](http://localhost:5000) to be running.~~
