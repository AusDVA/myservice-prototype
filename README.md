## Code style and quality
Before contributing to the codebase, please familiarise yourself with [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html). This is the style guide we've decided to adhere to.

[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) is the CSS and HTML naming conversion that all new code should adopt.

Install a sass linter e.g. [Sass Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glen-84.sass-lint). The .sasslintrc file in this project has been configured to reflect the Google style guide. 

## Other stuff
