<p>If you have been left with ongoing impairment you may be entitled to a compensation payment. We call this <a>Permanent Impairment Compensation.</a></p>
<p>
  You may be eligible if you meet all of the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      after treatment you still have an impairment or lifestyle restriction,
    </li>
    <li>
      the impairment or restriction is likely to continue indefinitely,
    </li>
    <li>
      your condition has stabilised.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have had a medical assessment you will be requested to provide details of this as part of this application. If you have not yet had a medical assessment, you can
    request for DVA to organise one on your behalf whilst completing this application.</p>
